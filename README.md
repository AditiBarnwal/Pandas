ðŸ’­ Why Pandas is used for Data Science?

***This is because pandas are used in conjunction with other libraries that are used for data science. It is built on the top of the NumPy library which means that a lot of structures of NumPy are used or replicated in Pandas. The data produced by Pandas are often used as input for plotting functions of Matplotlib, statistical analysis in SciPy, and machine learning algorithms in Scikit-learn.***

# Introduction
Pandas has two data structures for manipulating data, They are: 
- `Series`
- `DataFrame`

Series: 1D Array capable of holding data of any type(integer, string, float, python objects, etc.).The axis labels are collectively called indexes.Pandas Series is nothing but a column in an excel sheet.Pandas Series can be created from the lists, dictionary, and from a scalar value etc.

Binary operation methods on series:

FUNCTION	DESCRIPTION
- add()	Method is used to add series or list like objects with same length to the caller series
- sub()	Method is used to subtract series or list like objects with same length from the caller series
- mul()	Method is used to multiply series or list like objects with same length with the caller series
- div()	Method is used to divide series or list like objects with same length by the caller series
- sum()	Returns the sum of the values for the requested axis
- prod()	Returns the product of the values for the requested axis
- mean()	Returns the mean of the values for the requested axis
- pow()	Method is used to put each element of passed series as exponential power of caller series and returned the results
- abs()	Method is used to get the absolute numeric value of each element in Series/DataFrame
- cov()	Method is used to find covariance of two series
 
Pandas series method:

FUNCTION	DESCRIPTION
- Series()	A pandas Series can be created with the Series() constructor method. This constructor method accepts a variety of inputs

DataFrame: 2D size-mutable, heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns).2D data structure, i.e., data is aligned in a tabular fashion in rows and columns.3Components of Dataframe: data, rows, and columns.

Syntax:     `pandas.DataFrame(data, index, columns)`
where,

 - data: It is a dataset from which dataframe is to be created. It can be list, dictionary, scalar value, series, ndarrays, etc.
 - index: optional, index starts from 0 and ends at the last data value(n-1). It defines the row label explicitly.
 - columns: provide column names in the dataframe. If the column name is not defined by default, it will take a value from 0 to n-1.

`Parameters:-n: integer value, number of rows to be returned`

Pandas describe() is used to view some basic statistical details like percentile, mean, std etc. of a data frame or a series of numeric values. When this method is applied to a series of string, it returns a different output which is shown in the examples below.

Syntax: `DataFrame.describe(percentiles=None, include=None, exclude=None)`

     Parameters:
           - percentile: list like data type of numbers between 0-1 to return the respective percentile
           - include: List of data types to be included while describing dataframe. Default is None
           - exclude: List of data types to be Excluded while describing dataframe. Default is None

Data structure can be converted to NumPy ndarray with the help of the DataFrame.to_numpy() method. In this article we will see how to convert dataframe to numpy array.

Syntax of Pandas DataFrame.to_numpy()
Syntax: `Dataframe.to_numpy(dtype = None, copy = False) `

         Parameters: 

              - dtype: Data type which we are passing like str. 
              - copy: [bool, default False] Ensures that the returned value is a not a view on another array.
Returns: numpy.ndarray 

Pandas Series.as_matrix() function is used to convert the given series or dataframe object to Numpy-array representation.

Syntax: `Series.as_matrix(columns=None)`

        Parameter :
          - columns : If None, return all columns, otherwise, returns specified columns.

# Manipulating Data

# Grouping Data
 In real data science projects, youâ€™ll be dealing with large amounts of data and trying things over and over, so for efficiency, we use Groupby concept. Groupby concept is really important because itâ€™s ability to aggregate data efficiently, both in performance and the amount code is magnificent. Groupby mainly refers to a process involving one or more of the following steps they are: 
 ðŸ”† Splitting : It is a process in which we split data into group by applying some conditions on datasets.
 ðŸ”† Applying : It is a process in which we apply a function to each group independently
 ðŸ”† Combining : It is a process in which we combine different datasets after applying groupby and results into a data structure

Grouping Rows in pandas

# Working With Text Data

ðŸ’¢ Pandas.apply()

**Pandas.apply allow the users to pass a function and apply it on every single value of the Pandas series. It comes as a huge improvement for the pandas library as this function helps to segregate data according to the conditions required due to which it is efficiently used in data science and machine learning.**
Syntax:   `s.apply(func, convert_dtype=True, args=())`
Parameters:

-func: .apply takes a function and applies it to all values of pandas series.
-convert_dtype: Convert dtype as per the functionâ€™s operation.
-args=(): Additional arguments to pass to function instead of series.
-Return Type: Pandas Series after applied function/operation.

â–ª Apply function to every row in a Pandas DataFrame
â–ª Apply a function on each element of the series
â–ª Aggregation data across one or more column
â–ª Mean of the values for the requested axis
â–ª Mean of the underlying data in the Series
â–ª Mean absolute deviation of the values for the requested axis
â–ª Mean absolute deviation of the values for the Series
â–ª Unbiased standard error of the mean
â–ª Find the Series containing counts of unique values
â–ª Find the Series containing counts of unique values using Index.value_counts()

# Working with CSV and Excel files
# Operations
# Visualization

**Data Visualization is the presentation of data in graphical format. It helps people understand the significance of data by summarizing and presenting a huge amount of data in a simple and easy-to-understand format and helps communicate information clearly and effectively.**

Using built-in data visualization feature in pandas by plotting different types of charts.

Plot Types â€“
There are several plot types built-in to pandas, most of them statistical plots by nature:

`df.plot.area` `df.plot.barh` `df.plot.density` `df.plot.hist` `df.plot.line``df.plot.scatter` `df.plot.bar` `df.plot.box` `df.plot.hexbin` `df.plot.kde` `df.plot.pie`

You can also just call df.plot(kind='hist') or replace that kind argument with any of the key terms shown in the list above (e.g. â€˜boxâ€™, â€˜barhâ€™, etc.).

#### Box plot visualization with Pandas and Seaborn

***Box Plot is the visual representation of the depicting groups of numerical data through their quartiles. Boxplot is also used for detect the outlier in data set. It captures the summary of the data efficiently with a simple box and whiskers and allows us to compare easily across groups. Boxplot summarizes a sample data using 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles. These percentiles are also known as the lower quartile, median and upper quartile.***

A box plot consist of 5 things.

- Minimum
- First Quartile or 25%
- Median (Second Quartile) or 50%
- Third Quartile or 75%
- Maximum

Draw the boxplot using seaborn library:

Syntax :
`seaborn.boxplot(x=None, y=None, hue=None, data=None, order=None, hue_order=None, orient=None, color=None, palette=None, saturation=0.75, width=0.8, dodge=True, fliersize=5, linewidth=None, whis=1.5, notch=False, ax=None, **kwargs)`

Parameters:
-x = feature of dataset
-y = feature of dataset
-hue = feature of dataset
-data = dataframe or full dataset
-color = color name
